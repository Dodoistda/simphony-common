# Questions after upload the first proposal:
# - Does a mterial relation belong to cuds or rather to material-relation
#   as stated in the wiki?
# - In case it belongs to material-relations, would it make sense to also move
#   material-relations.yml to material-relations directory?
# - Why are we generating a single different material-relation for every
#   existing instalation of a material-relation?
